# Password_manager
DSP project for PGPDS at Praxis. I created the backend and the frontend for this project.

Features:

1.	No. of encoding schemes used: 12
'blake2b','blake2s','md5','sha1','sha224','sha256','sha384','sha3_224','sha3_256','sha3_384','sha3_512','sha512'

2.	Password is generated by hashing a random 10 digit no. is generated

3.	Password structure: (0:15)(Random_alphabet_in_caps)(*)(15:29)
The digits are the first n digits from the hashed password generated. Total size: 32 bits

4.	Every time a new website login is set up, a different hashing scheme is selected from the available ones, in a round robin fashion. 
    This counter is also stored in a database in the cloud.

5.	User only needs to remember the master password; this is hashed using SHA224.

6.	On forgetting the master password, it can be reset by answering the security question and OTP.

7.	Passwords are stored in a SQL database in the cloud.

8.	Security question’s answers are hashed using SHA224 and stored locally.

9.	In case a website login is compromised, the password can be regenerated on answering the security question and entering the OTP sent to the phone.

10.	After login, if the user wants to retrieve a website’s password, on authentication, it is flashed on the screen.
